# ggeBot
A bot for GoodGame Empire's Storm Islands (and maybe fortresses?), for now, it only works in 1920x1080

Still a lot to go, very basic GUI , only works in 1080p and not the best digit recognizer

Next thing to do is change digit recognizer, instead of recognizing digits by passing the mouse over a fortress, recognize them when trying to attack a blocked fortress, cause it will have a constant background and match template should work better
